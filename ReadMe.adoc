= Project: {HEAT LOCK}

IoT Heat Lock is a system of a smart lock that locks and unlocks based on human presence in a certain room. 
Flow Chart:
             |--------------------------------|
             |                                |
             v                                |
Check human presence --yes--> (stay) unlock --|
                   L--no--> lock ---> keypad turns on ---> is password correct? --yes--> unlock
                                                                              L---no--> lock

== Step 1: Installation

1. Open this file
2. Download AMG8833 library in arduino IDE (make sure you get the adafruit one!)
3. Edit the file as how you like.
4. Debug if there's any problem.
5. Release to the world!

== Step 2: Assemble the circuit

Just assemble the BOM as how you want, there's no specific things.
Just remember if you mistake the GND and 5V the sensor will be hottt and it might cause a defect. 
Ensure the wiring is correct before any test run!!

== Step 3: Load the code

Upload the code contained in this sketch on to your board
